<h1>The Kraken</h1>

<h2>Alfred, Lord Tennyson 1809-1892</h2>

<!-- I am adding a comment here. Hello -->

<p>Below the thunders of the upper deep,<br>
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,<br>
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep<br>
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee<br>
About his shadowy sides; above him swell<br>
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;<br>
And far away into the sickly light,<br>
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell<br>
Unnumbered and enormous polypi<br>
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.<br>
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie<br>
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,<br>
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;<br>
Then once by man and angels to be seen,<br>
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.</p>
